## Key Features

- Browser-based VS Code using [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) accessed through Amazon CloudFront
- Git version control using [git-remote-s3](https://github.com/awslabs/git-remote-s3) with Amazon S3 storage
- Automated deployments using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild
- Password rotation using AWS Secrets Manager (30-day automatic rotation)
- Pre-configured AWS development environment:
  - AWS Toolkit for VS Code
  - Terraform infrastructure deployment
  - Docker support
  - Git integration

## Quick Start

1. Launch the AWS CloudFormation template `sample-developer-environment.yml`
2. Choose your initial workspace content:
   - Provide a GitHub repository URL in `GitHubRepo` parameter, OR
   - Provide S3 bucket name `S3AssetBucket` and `S3AssetPrefix` parameters
3. Access VS Code through the provided CloudFormation output URL
4. Get your password from AWS Secrets Manager (link in outputs)
5. Click *File* > *Open Folder* and navigate to `/home/ec2-user/my-workspace`. This is the git/S3 initialized project directory
6. Test code in `dev`, copy to `release`, commit and push to trigger deployment


## Configuration Options

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `CodeServerVersion` | Version of code-server to install |
| `GitHubRepo` | Public repository to clone as initial workspace. Note: Using a custom repository will not include the sample application |
| `S3AssetBucket` | (Optional) S3 bucket containing initial workspace content. Overwrites GitHubRepo if provided |
| `S3AssetPrefix` | (Optional) S3 bucket asset prefix path. Only required when S3AssetBucket is specified. Needs to end with `/` |
| `DeployPipeline` | Enable AWS CodePipeline deployments |
| `RotateSecret` | Enable AWS Secrets Manager rotation |
| `AutoSetDeveloperProfile` | Automatically set Developer profile as default in code-server terminal sessions without requiring manual elevation |
| `InstallDotNet` | Install .NET SDK  |
| `InstanceArchitecture` | Choose between ARM and x86 architecture |
| `InstanceType` | Pick Amazon EC2 instance type |

## Useful File Locations

Here are some handy files you'll find on the EC2 instance:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/etc/devbox-env.sh` | Environment variables file |
| `/var/lib/cloud/instance/setup-status.log` | Installation status tracking file |
| `/var/lib/cloud/scripts/per-boot/setup.sh` | Setup script location (runs on every boot) |
| `/var/log/devbox-setup.log` | Log file for setup script output |

## Amazon Q CLI Setup

1. Follow the [Amazon Q Developer Getting Started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/getting-started.html) - choose Free/Pro tier and authentication method
2. Run `install.sh` and follow prompts

3. Navigate to workspace: `cd /home/ec2-user/workspace/my-workspace`
4. (optional) Set the default agent: `q settings chat.defaultAgent platform-engineer`
5. Start with `q chat` or `q chat --agent platform-engineer`
6. Use `/model` to select AI model, `/tools` to see available MCP tools
7. Browse [AWS Labs MCP](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) for additional MCP servers
8. Create additional agents by adding new files to `.amazonq/cli-agents/`
9. Use Amazon Q CLI to accelerate your development üöÄ

## AWS IAM Roles

The environment is configured with two IAM roles:
1. EC2 instance role - Basic permissions for the instance
2. Developer role - Elevated permissions for AWS operations

The developer role has the permissions needed to deploy the sample application. To view or modify these permissions, search for "iamroledeveloper" in the CloudFormation template.

This separation ensures the EC2 instance runs with minimal permissions by default, while allowing controlled elevation of privileges when needed.

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Tip**: Run `echo 'export AWS_PROFILE=developer' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc` to make the developer profile default for all terminal sessions.

If you wish to have elevated AWS permissions automatically enabled in all new terminal sessions without requiring manual profile switching, set `AutoSetDeveloperProfile` to true. While convenient, this bypasses the security practice of explicit privilege elevation.

## Architecture

The environment runs in a private subnet with CloudFront access, using S3 for git storage and CodePipeline for automated deployments.

## Sample Application

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: The sample application is only available when using the default value for `GitHubRepo`. If you specify either a custom `GitHubRepo` or `S3AssetBucket`, you will need to provide your own Terraform application code.

The repository includes a Terraform application that deploys:
- Static website hosted on Amazon S3
- Amazon CloudFront distribution with AWS WAF protection
- Security headers and AWS KMS encryption
- Amazon CloudWatch logging

![Sample Application](img/sampleapplication.png)

The application deploys automatically when you set the CloudFormation parameter `DeployPipeline` to true. Once deployment completes, you can locate the website URL in the final output of the CodeBuild job.

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: If using CodePipeline (DeployPipeline=true), before removing the CloudFormation stack:
1. Run the 'terraform-destroy' pipeline in CodePipeline
2. Approve the manual approval step when prompted
3. Wait for pipeline completion

Failing to run and approve the destroy pipeline will leave orphaned infrastructure resources in your AWS account that were created by Terraform and will need to be cleaned up manually.

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This sample uses HTTP for internal traffic between the Application Load Balancer and code-server Amazon EC2 instance. While external traffic is secured through CloudFront HTTPS, it is strongly recommended to:
- Configure end-to-end HTTPS using custom SSL certificates on the ALB
- Update ALB listener and target group to use HTTPS/443
- Use a custom domain name with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates
